To simplify setting up and running Snowplow, the Snowplow Analytics team provide public hosting for some of the Snowplow sub-components. These hosted assets are publically available through Amazon Web Services (CloudFront and S3), and using them is free for Snowplow community members.

As we release new versions of these assets, we will leave old versions unchanged on their existing URLs - so you won't have to upgrade your own Snowplow installation unless you want to.

**Disclaimer: While Snowplow Analytics Ltd will make every reasonable effort to host these assets, we will not be liable for any failure to provide this service. All of the hosted assets listed below are freely available via [our GitHub repository][snowplow-repo] and you are encouraged to host them yourselves.**

The **current versions** of the assets hosted by the Snowplow Analytics team are as follows:

## 0. Snowplow CLI

We are steadily moving over to [Bintray][bintray] for hosting binaries and artifacts which don't have to be hosted on S3.

To make operating Snowplow easier, the EmrEtlRunner app are now available as prebuilt executables in a single zipfile here:

    http://dl.bintray.com/snowplow/snowplow-generic/snowplow_emr_r97_knossos.zip

Right-click on this [Download link][emr-download] to save it down locally.

**Note**: The link above refers to the latest version at the time of writing (R97). If you know there is a newer version you can locate and download it from the [generic page](http://dl.bintray.com/snowplow/snowplow-generic/). Search for the pattern `snowplow_emr_`. The higher the number version the newer it is.
