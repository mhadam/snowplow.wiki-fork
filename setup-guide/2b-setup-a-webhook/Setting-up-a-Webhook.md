Snowplow allows you to collect events via the [webhooks][webhooks-defn] of supported third-party software.

Webhooks allow this third-party software to send their own internal event streams to [Snowplow Collectors](Setting-up-a-Collector) for further processing. Webhooks are sometimes referred to as "streaming APIs" or "HTTP response APIs".
